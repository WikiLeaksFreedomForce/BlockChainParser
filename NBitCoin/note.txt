This folder contains a compiled version of

https://github.com/MetacoSA/NBitcoin/archive/master.zip

This is only used for the blockchain script parser to convert into string.

For some reason the nuget packages were not working so here are the compiled DLLs.

Feel free to recompile from the above link if you would rather have verifiable code. I really tried to make the nuget package work but my vs.net wouldnt have any of it.
